A simple music player application which access audio files with external Storage. 
I had used the Dexter android extenal library, which is an Android library that simplifies the process of requesting permissions at runtime. 
Also I had used the media Library.
Dexter gives free permission code from my activities and lets me write that logic anywhere I want.
Media Library is a service enable application to browse media content provided by an Application and ask the application to control the Media Play.
Media library I had used for the creation of notification.
This is the two libraries which is used externally to this application.
Interfaces also included in this code for the notification.java file.
